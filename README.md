## Simple but fun Javascript game
The game taps into your hand-to-eye coordination as you try to hit a static target with a moving object. With each success, you accrue points and the object starts to move faster, making the game increasingly difficult. There is a leader board that saves your highest score and displays the top 10 players with best scores.

I built this game for education purposes only. With the abundance of JS frameworks and libraries out there, I thought it is about time I go back to basics and build something with purely native, vanilla JS. I have always wanted to play more with CSS animations and SVGs so I built all the gameplay elements using them.

I have implemented rudimentary concepts of login and sorting algorithms. They are not the most secure or performant, but they taught me what are some of the caveats gotchas developers need to be aware of when designing and developing such systems at an enterprise level.
